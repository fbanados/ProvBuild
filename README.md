# ProvBuild

This repository provides the ProvBuild tool for the paper "Improving Data Scientist Efficiency with Provenance".

## About ProvBuild
ProvBuild is a data analysis environment that uses change impact analysis to improve the iterative editing process in script-based workflow pipelines by harnessing a scriptâ€™s provenance.

ProvBuild obtains provenance using noWorkflow, a Python-based provenance capture tool. Using the provenance information, ProvBuild identifies dependencies between inputs, program statements, functions, variables, and outputs, allowing it to precisely identify the sections of a script that must be re-executed to correctly update results after a modification. ProvBuild then generates a customized script, the _ProvScript_, that contains only those sections affected by a modification.

## Instructions to Run in a VM
As Python 2 has been deprecated, it is not immediately available on new Mac OS versions.
However, you can run ProvBuild in a VirtualBox image:

### Setup of the VM

1. Download an [Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ubuntu-22.04-live-server-amd64.iso) ISO image.
2. Create a new VirtualBox VM.
3. **Before installing**, add a second network interface (to access from your machine):
   - Go to `Settings -> Network -> Adapter 2`
   - Check `Enable Network Adapter`
   - in the `Attached to:` drop-down menu, select `Host-only Adapter`, which will create a local switch between the VM and your machine.
   - Click `OK`
4. Install Ubuntu, by running the machine, loading the ISO and following the instructions.
   - Choose the "Ubuntu Server" option (not minimized)
   - You do not need to select any snaps.

### Setup of the tool 
1. Check-out the repository.  The following repo has very minor modifications from the original to make it run in a vm:
   ```
   > git clone https://github.com/fbanados/ProvBuild.git
   ```
2. Move to the appropriate directory:
   ```
   > cd ProvBuild
   ```
3. Run the script to collect all dependencies:
   ```
   > ./initialize.sh
   ```
4. Identify the IP address of the VM in the second interface (that is accessible from your computer):
   ```
   > ip a
   ```
You can now jump to the "ProvBuild Interface and Demo" section.  Note that Step 1 will initialize the server, but not open the browser, you will need to identif
   

## Tool
ProvBuild is built on top of noWorkflow (Version 1.11.2). Check out [noWorkflow's Github](https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow) for more information details.

### Prerequisites
This version of ProvBuild only support **Python 2.7**. ProvBuild and all tests are developed under Linux and macOS. Windows may not be supported by this tool.

To install ProvBuild, you should follow these basic instructions:

If you have python `pip`, install the following packages:

	$ pip install flask
	$ pip install sqlalchemy
	$ pip install pyposast
	$ pip install future
	$ pip install apted

### Clone the Repository

	$ git clone https://github.com/CrystalMei/ProvBuild.git
	$ cd ProvBuild
	
### ProvBuild Interface and Demo
- Step 1: The user runs `python app.py` and it will start a webpage as shown below:
![StartPage](img/0.png)

- Step 2: The user selects ProvBuild mode and upload demo script `./example/Demo.py` (Note: We designed _User_ _name_ for user study in our paper (Study 1). It is not required for daily use.):
![](img/1.png)

- Step 3: After script submission, the webpage will be updated:
![](img/2.png)

- Step 4: The user inputs the name of the function or variable (e.g. variable `z` in `Demo.py`) to edit:
![](img/4.png)

- Step 5: After click **Search**, ProvBuild extracts the object's dependencies based on the stored provenance information and generates a _ProvScript_ containing only code pertaining to the chosen object. The webpage will be updated:
![](img/5.png)

- Step 6: The user directly makes modifications on the _ProvScript_ (shown as {1}). After click **Run**, instead of running the original `Demo.py`, ProvBuild executes the shortened _ProvScript_ for the user (shown as {2}):
![](img/6.png)

- Step 7:  The program results will be updated (shown as {1}). After click **Merge**, the user seasily merge edits from the _ProvScript_ into the original `Demo.py` (shown as {2}):
![](img/7.png)

- Step 8: The original file will be updated with the user's modification:
![](img/8.png)

### Run ProvBuild Manually (Linux/MaxOS only)
* Initial and run the given test Python script: `./make.sh r <script_name>.py`

* If you want to modify a function, get the ProvScript with the given function: `./make.sh uf <function_name>`

* If you want to modify a variable, get the ProvScript with the given variable: `./make.sh uv <variable_name>`

* Execute the ProvScript and update the result: `./make.sh d`

* Merge the ProvScript into the original test script: `./make.sh m`
